# USB-Monitor-Python-
This is a python script to be run on command prompt to check the status of USB devices connected .
One of the Codes is for Windows CMD , it basically offers an option to put in your own API key of VirusTotal in order for a better scan.Can be run with or without Administrative access depending on your device inserted. 
I will be soon adding  one  for Linux too, this one might be a bit faulty as i am still working on this but i believe it will run a basic scan on your linux  system.Do note I havent put option of API key of VirusTotal in here till yet.
